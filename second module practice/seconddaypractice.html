        Heaven from hell? <br>
        Blue skies from pain? <br>
        Can you tell a green field <br>
        From a cold steel rail? <br>

    Your heroes for ghosts? <br>
    Hot ashes for trees? <br>
    Hot air for a cool breeze? <br>
    Cold comfort for change? <br>
    Did you exchange <br>
    A walk-on part in the war <br>
    For a leading role in a cage? <br>
